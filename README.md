# Benchmarking a model of memory

## Purpose 

This project aims at benchmarking a model of memory using different programming languages. The purpose is to show how fast different programming languages perform using a simple, but realistic project.
The memory model is sufficiently easy to understand to be communicated to a broad audience, less familiar or exposed to modeling, while having some practical implications for researchers.

## Implementation

Could use a closed-form expression for instance. However, not the purpose. Here I compared different programming languages using a sensibly similar implementation and ways to pass variables through functions.
